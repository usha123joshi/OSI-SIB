        <p>The turning point of P T Usha’s life was when her coach spotted her in 1976 at National School Games. Coach O. M. Nambiar found the young champ, P T Usha at the annual school tournament. He was there as a guest for prize distribution. Her fast walking style and lean shape impressed the coach, and he saw the future. With her physique, he truly believed that P T Usha could be one of the finest sprinters in the sports world.
            <br>
            Coach O. M. Nambiar says she was not like an ordinary person in sports. She was different and very punctual. Also, they lived in a very close location, as a result of which they had ample time to train together, and even the results were very quick.
            <br>
            By this time, she had developed such skills and abilities that she dominated state and national at 16. She is the youngest Indian athlete (sprinter) in Olympics.
            <br>
            Usha started surprising everyone in 1978 at Quilon Nationals and never looked back again. There she won five medals. When she moved from school to college, she won 14 Gold out of 15 at state-level sports organized by Kerala. Her coach was very confident about her. He even says that she was unbeatable in the 200m race.
